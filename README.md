# Hello world! 

>In the terminal you need to go into the **wCsJS** directory of your fork and run this command line `npm run dev` to see the web app running on your machine.

*I add that we need to install nodejs for the web components JavaScript and ViteJS to work with the command line* `npm install node`.
